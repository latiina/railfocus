                                <p>As I have explained elsewhere, Rail Focus
                                    is very much a one-man, hobby project. There
                                    is no large group of people behind it, nor is
                                    there any kind of funding - just me!<br><br>

                                    But everyone reading this can help, by passing
                                    details of this newsletter onto friends and family, or colleagues who may be
                                    interested,
                                    and by clicking on any of the adverts that
                                    interest you. The whole thing is being funded
                                    out of my own pocket, because it is something
                                    I thought would be fun and interesting to do,
                                    and for people to read. But clicking on the
                                    adverts, earns a small amount (around 15-20p
                                    usually) everytime an advert is clicked on -
                                    that, I am hoping will help to cover the running
                                    costs, and allow me to keep Rail Focus going.<br><br>

                                    I am very grateful to several friends (you know
                                    who you are!) who have donated time and
                                    knowledge to put the website together for me,
                                    and to help with images as required.</p>

                                    Welcome to this, the first edition of Rail Focus. The aim behind this project is to
                                    fulfil
                                    an interest
                                    of mine, to try out different ways of working and to hopefully provide an interesting
                                    read
                                    to people,
                                    as well as a selection of images, roughly every two to three weeks.
                                </span><br><br>

                                I have had an interest in the UK national network for many years, and to a smaller extend
                                heritage
                                steam and European railways, especially within Germany. While this email version of a blog
                                will
                                concentrate on the National Network within the Great Britain, the other areas of my
                                interests
                                may make
                                an appearance from time to time. My aim is not to try and be a big magazine like you would
                                buy
                                from the
                                newsagents, more to focus on a few stories and small features, told in my own words and
                                photos,
                                that I
                                think may interest people. There is a link further down on the right that will allow you to
                                pass
                                comments back, or perhaps suggest ideas for future stories/features.<br><br>

                                So how do you obtain Rail Focus and read it? Well firstly, it's free! There's nothing to
                                pay
                                (although
                                there is a donation
                                button if you want to say thanks with a few quid!) so at its very basic level you could
                                just
                                come onto
                                the website every so
                                often and read the current and previous editions. Alternatively, you could register your
                                email
                                address
                                and every time a
                                new edition is published, it will arrive on your email, so you don't need to visit the site
                                at
                                all. As
                                a note, I have put a privacy
                                policy on the site, but in essence, if you sign up to receive Rail Focus, your email
                                address is
                                used
                                just for that - it's not sold or give to anyone else, and you won't get bombarded with
                                emails
                                from me,
                                either.<br><br>

                                I do want to make clear that this is very much a one-man hobby project, whether it grows
                                beyond
                                that in
                                the future is anyone's guess, but while I am aiming to produce an update roughly
                                fortnightly,
                                those
                                timescales may vary as we go through the year. However, I do need help from you, the
                                readers.
                                Please
                                pass reference about

                                the

                                them)
                                but
                                despite being digital,
                                there are some costs incurred through sending emails, hosting the website etc, so if you
                                see an
                                advert

                                Further down in this edition, I have taken a look at how the Rail Head Treatment Trains
                                have changed over the years, so it is perhaps a good opportunity to start with a picture of one of this year’s workings. Those trains operating out of York usually make use of Class 20 locomotives, which have a low axle weight, because of some restrictions en route. Here 20302 is joined by 20312 as they power through Althorpe, near Scunthorpe. The lifting bridge, called the King George V bridge, is one that dates from 19xx, and I always think makes a nice backdrop to an image. The bridge celebrated its ima100th anniversary
                                last year and was designed to lift to allowing sailing barges on the River Trent to pass underneath.

                    <h2>How the Great Western electrification is progressing</h2>
                    <span>
                        Each day, South West Trains operates over 1,600 trains across its suburban and main line networks,
                        stretching
                        from London Waterloo, through the London suburbs
                        into Devon and Dorset.
                    </span><br><br>

                    The vast majority of those operations are formed of electric multiple units from Classes 444, 450, 455,
                    456
                    or
                    458, with the remainder being diesel worked with Class
                    158s or 159s from Salisbury Depot. While Northam, near Southampton, looks after the Siemens Class 444
                    and
                    450
                    fleets, the remaining three classes are all under the
                    watchful eye of Wimbledon Traincare Depot, as far as exams and maintenance are concerned.<br><br>

                    The stabling facility at Wimbledon was first created by the London & South Western Railway (LSWR), the
                    precursor to the Southern Railway as a stabling and
                    cleaning base for its fleet of Electric Multiple Units, but the site has a closer affiliation with the
                    EMU
                    network than most. Part of the current depot, was originally the
                    location of Durnsford Road Power Station, a facility built by the LSWR around the early 1900s, shortly
                    before
                    the start of the First World War, to provide electrical
                    power to the network. The boilers here were fed from a high-level bunker line, with coal wagons (that
                    had
                    arrived loaded by rail) being propelled up the concrete
                    ramp by small Bo-Bo electric locomotives. The power station, concrete ramp and location of the main
                    line,
                    as it
                    was in 1924, can be seen in this view on the
                    ‘Britain from Above’ website. <br><br>

                    Until the development of Wimbledon Depot in the early 1970s, Durnsford Road Depot was an
                    eight road facility, located around the area where the new bogie drop is now located. A fairly
                    simple affair, it allowed the outstabling of units during the day, or between duties. In April 1974 the
                    new Wimbledon Depot opened as part of the Regional Berthing and Maintenance Plan created
                    by what was then British Rail’s Southern Region. Built on the land of the former power station, and
                    bringing about the demolition of the old Durnsford Road shed, it result in the creation of
                    dedicated undercover maintenance, repair and servicing sheds, along with stabling facilities, the
                    latter of which were also created at Staines.<br><br>

                    Today, the site employs 198 members of staff, from the management team down to fitters and
                    cleaners, who are responsible for the delivery into service of safe, maintained and clean trains. In
                    total 91 Class 455 four-car, 24 Class 456 two-car and 36 Class 458/5 five-car EMUs are allocated to
                    Wimbledon and each weekday, the depot is required to provide 82, 20 and 32 sets respectively,
                    for service, a tall order that shows how heavily SWTs unit fleet is diagrammed. Of the nine Class
                    455s that are not required for service, two will be located at Bournemouth Depot at anyone time
                    for their second C6 exam, which consists of a heavy overhaul including a complete repaint, three
                    sets will be at Eastleigh Works for AC traction conversion and depending on where in the
                    maintenance cycle the sets are there could be another unit at Bournemouth for a C4 exam,
                    which basically deals with bogies, underframes, wheels and couplings. The remaining three/four
                    sets are therefore available to Wimbledon for planned or corrective maintenance.<br><br>

                    The heavy maintenance was moved to the expanded depot at Bournemouth following the creation of spare
                    capacity as a result of the Class 442 work being lost a few
                    years ago. SWT to took the decision to invest in the depot as it strategic long-term overhaul facility,
                    which included the installation of a dedicated, purpose-built
                    paintshop. While the movement of units to and fromthe depot incurs a small cost and manpower
                    requirement
                    (i.e. The driver) it remains a more cost-effective option
                    than employing a larger workshop to undertake the necessary tasks.<br><br>

                    Wimbledon is also handling a number of local modifications to its fleet. With the Class 458 EMUs,
                    this involves the fitment of WiFi facilities, with around half of the units now been fitted. The Class
                    455s are being fitted with expanded stand hoppers, to allow them to be refilled from within
                    the train.<br><br>

                    With the exception of the new bogie drop building, the layout of the depot is fairly similar to the
                    condition in which it was built in 1973/74. The depot site is divided into a north end and south end
                    as a result of Durnsford Road. The south end handles the main day-to-day maintenance and
                    repair aspects of the site, with the maintenance shed here comprising of seven single ended roads,
                    two of which (Nos. 12 and 13 roads) are four-car length and being equipped with lifting facilities,
                    form the depots lift shop. Roads 11-9 are eight-car length and have pits to allow low-level and
                    underneath access. Work will shortly commence to extend these roads to 10-car length to allow
                    the new Siemens Class 707 ‘Desiro City’ vehicles to be maintained. The work is expected to
                    take around 12-months to complete, and involves lengthening the roads by one-vehicle length
                    at both ends of the building, due to the restrictions of the site. Roads 7 and 8 are the longest,
                    being able to accommodate 12-car sets, again with pit access along the entire length. Outside
                    the maintenance sheds are a further five roads (Nos 1-6) that provide stabling, with two of these
                    roads also giving the ability to empty the on-board retention tank toilet system. It should be
                    noted that the installation of the toilet emptying system resulted in the removal of Road 3.<br><br>

                    Recently, the new bogie drop facility has been installed which has removed a significant
                    workload from the lift shop, allowing the latter to concentrate on other maintenance
                    requirements. The bogie facility allows SWT to ‘drop’ the bogies, wheelsets or traction motors out of a
                    unit for attention. The building is also fitted with an in-situ wheel
                    lathe as part of the bogie drop.<br><br>

                    At the north end of the site, nearest to Wimbledon station and adjacent to the flyover, is the depot
                    servicing area, which concentrates purely on cleaning and preparation
                    of units ready for their next working. Roads 1-2 are known as the ‘transfer roads’ and temporarily hold
                    units waiting to move from the Yard along to the Depot for
                    further attention. Road 3 deals with retention tank emptying and roads 4-9 are covered accommodation
                    roads
                    within the covered accommodation, allowing cleaners
                    safe and easy access to the units. Finally, roads 10-24 are purely for berthing units awaiting their
                    next
                    duty.<br><br>

                    The depot operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and during the day time, will generally be
                    dealing
                    with pre-planned maintenance, such as A, B or C exams, on the
                    day of our visit, (45)5871 was present for attention to a cab-to-cab defect. A further pair of Class
                    455s,
                    Nos. (45)5860 and (45)5717 had been allocated to a short
                    morning peak-hour working only, to allow them to visit the depot for attention to a loss of power
                    report
                    from the previous day, before being returned to traffic for the
                    evening rush-hour. However with set utilisation and the current exam situation giving two spare units,
                    the
                    decision was taken to hold them on Depot that evening,
                    using the two spare sets to cover the allocated diagram, there by giving engineers at Wimbledon more
                    time
                    to diagnose and correct the fault.<br><br>

                    While the bogie drop and wheel lathe facility is primarily used by SWT EMU vehicles, and little outside
                    work is undertaken, there is a regular pathway in the system
                    from Salisbury Depot, allowing the transfer of SWT Class 158 and 159 vehicles to Wimbledon for wheelset
                    attention, on an ‘as required’, but invariably weekly, basis.
                    A production meeting is held at 08:15 each morning, with a run through of which units are stopped and
                    the
                    work being carried out, the expected time for each set
                    to return to traffic and also looking at an overview of the current workload. Twice a day, at 06:00 and
                    18:00 an update of pre-allocated work from the maintenance
                    controllers in the Waterloo Integrated Control Centre (WICC) is sent through, although discussions are
                    ongoing throughout the day between the Depot and the
                    WICC with regards to this work. Diagramming and programming of sets for exams, especially Class 455
                    work,
                    is a highly time sensitive job. Arrival of a set before
                    the Depot is ready means that not only is the fleet potentially a set short for the allocated number
                    required in traffic each day, but it is also sat on depot unnecessarily
                    while arrival of a set too late means that the engineering staff allocated to that work could be sat
                    around
                    with nothing to do, so the accurate planning of new arrivals,
                    and release from previous exams can make a huge difference to the smooth running of things.Overnight
                    work
                    will concentrate on cleaning and servicing, along with
                    running repairs and general day-to-day checks and short exams, that can be quickly completed during the
                    late evening/early hours of the morning downtime.<br><br>

                    While the workload at Wimbledon is unlikely to change significantly in the coming years where the
                    existing
                    fleet is concerned, big changes are ahead to
                    accommodate the new Class 707 EMUs, now being built by Siemens in Germany. As well as the extension of
                    Roads 9-11 in the Maintenance Shed mentioned earlier,
                    a new stores building is being constructed on site to hold spares, and berthing roads 21-27 are being
                    extended from eight to 10-car roads. The addition of new ‘707’
                    work at Wimbledon will bring added pressure to the depot workload, which is already at capacity
                    overnight.
                    Part of the ability to ‘add-in’ the ‘707’ servicing is the
                    conversion of the Class 455s from DC to AC traction equipment which has provided a significant increase
                    in
                    reliability and allowed the maintenance plan to move
                    from a cycle based around 10,000 miles between exams, to 15,000. This reduction in workload means that
                    Wimbledon then has the capacity to accept the new
                    ‘Desiro City’ trains, which themselves will operate 20,000 miles between exams.<br><br>

                    Out of the 30 five-car units being built, once fully commissioned, a total of 27 will be required for
                    public services every day, with the first expected to go into traffic in
                    mid-April next year, likely as a pair forming a 10-car set. While the ‘707s’ are due to start arriving
                    in
                    the country in mid-November, they will be commissioned
                    through Three Bridges and Clapham Junction Yard initially. The first six sets will be required to
                    undertake
                    5,000 miles of trouble-free operation before being handed
                    over to SWT, while the remaining 24 will have to undertaken 1,000 miles of trouble-free test running.<br><br>

                    <header>Rail Focus needs YOUR help</header>
                    <p>As I have explained elsewhere, Rail Focus
                        is very much a one-man, hobby project. There
                        is no large group of people behind it, nor is
                        there any kind of funding - just me!<br><br>

                        But everyone reading this can help, by passing
                        details of this newsletter onto friends and family, or colleagues who may be interested,
                        and by clicking on any of the adverts that
                        interest you. The whole thing is being funded
                        out of my own pocket, because it is something
                        I thought would be fun and interesting to do,
                        and for people to read. But clicking on the
                        adverts, earns a small amount (around 15-20p
                        usually) everytime an advert is clicked on -
                        that, I am hoping will help to cover the running
                        costs, and allow me to keep Rail Focus going.<br><br>

                        I am very grateful to several friends (you know
                        who you are!) who have donated time and
                        knowledge to put the website together for me,
                        and to help with images as required.</p>

                                Each day, South West Trains operates over 1,600 trains across its suburban and main line
                                networks,
                                stretching from London Waterloo, through the London suburbs into Devon and Dorset.<br><br>

                                The vast majority of those operations are formed of electric multiple units from Classes
                                444, 450,
                                455, 456 or 458, with the remainder being diesel worked with Class 158s or 159s from

                                The stabling facility at Wimbledon was first created by the London &
                                South Western Railway (LSWR), the precursor to the Southern Railway
                                as a stabling and cleaning base for its fleet of Electric Multiple Units, but
                                the site has a closer affiliation with the EMU network than most. Part of
                                the current depot, was originally the location of Durnsford Road Power
                                Station, a facility built by the LSWR around the early 1900s, shortly
                                before the start of the First World War, to provide electrical power to the
                                network. The boilers here were fed from a high-level bunker line, with
                                coal wagons (that had arrived loaded by rail) being propelled up the
                                concrete ramp by small Bo-Bo electric locomotives. The power station,
                                concrete ramp and location of the main line, as it was in 1924, can be
                                seen in this view on the ‘Britain from Above’ website.<br><br>

                                Until the development of Wimbledon Depot in the early 1970s, Durnsford
                                Road Depot was an eight road facility, located around the area where the
                                new bogie drop is now located. A fairly simple affair, it allowed the
                                outstabling of units during the day, or between duties. In April 1974 the
                                new Wimbledon Depot opened as part of the Regional Berthing and
                                Maintenance Plan created by what was then British Rail’s Southern Region. Built on the land
                                of the
                                former power
                                station, and bringing about the demolition of the old Durnsford Road shed, it result in the
                                creation of dedicated
                                undercover maintenance, repair and servicing sheds, along with stabling facilities, the
                                latter of
                                which were also created
                                at Staines. <br><br>

                                Today, the site employs 198 members of staff, from the management
                                team down to fitters and cleaners, who are responsible for the delivery
                                \into service of safe, maintained and clean trains. In total 91 Class 455
                                four-car, 24 Class 456 two-car and 36 Class 458/5 five-car EMUs are
                                allocated to Wimbledon and each weekday, the depot is required to
                                provide 82, 20 and 32 sets respectively, for service, a tall order that shows
                                how heavily SWTs unit fleet is diagrammed. Of the nine Class 455s that
                                are not required for service, two will be located at Bournemouth Depot at
                                anyone time for their second C6 exam, which consists of a heavy overhaul
                                including a complete repaint, three sets will be at Eastleigh Works for AC
                                traction conversion and depending on where in the maintenance cycle the
                                sets are there could be another unit at Bournemouth for a C4 exam, which
                                basically deals with bogies, underframes, wheels and couplings. The
                                remaining three/four sets are therefore available to Wimbledon for
                                planned or corrective maintenance.<br><br>

                                The heavy maintenance was moved to the expanded depot at
                                Bournemouth following the creation of spare capacity as a result of the
                                Class 442 work being lost a few years ago. SWT to took the decision to invest in the depot
                                as it
                                strategic long-term
                                overhaul facility, which included the installation of a dedicated, purpose-built paintshop.
                                While
                                the movement of units
                                to and fromthe depot incurs a small cost and manpower requirement (i.e. The driver) it
                                remains a
                                more cost-effective
                                option than employing a larger workshop to undertake the necessary tasks.<br><br>

                                With the exception of the new bogie drop building, the layout of the depot is fairly
                                similar to the
                                condition in which it
                                was built in 1973/74. The depot site is divided into a north end and south end as a result
                                of
                                Durnsford Road. The south
                                end handles the main day-to-day maintenance and repair aspects of the site, with the
                                maintenance
                                shed here
                                comprising of seven single ended roads,two of which (Nos. 12 and 13 roads) are four-car
                                length and
                                being equipped with
                                lifting facilities, form the depots lift shop. Roads 11-9 are eight-car length and have
                                pits to
                                allow low-level and
                                underneath access. Work will shortly commence to extend these roads to 10-car length to
                                allow the
                                new Siemens Class
                                707 ‘Desiro City’ vehicles to be maintained. The work is expected to take around 12-months
                                to
                                complete, and involves
                                lengthening the roads by one-vehicle length at both ends of the building, due to the
                                restrictions
                                of the site.

                                    content is likely to change, and some may
                                    be photographic based, others might look
                                    at useful websites that I have come across,
                                    or interesting books that I think readers
                                    may find useful. Some editions may even

                                    words this is the ‘lucky dip’ section!

                                    We start this first edition, with a Photo
                                    Essay that looks at images taken from a
                                    different view point. I enjoy experiencing
                                    images where the photographer has moved
                                    away from the standard front-three-
                                    quarter picture, and included the railway
                                    and its surroundings in a different way.

                                        clicks on an image. Where images are
                                        grouped, either within a story, or like here
                                        within a heading, it should be possible to

                                    I am always amazed at those useful little
                                    websites that we stumble across, while
                                    looking for something else, so this is the

                                    the rest of you! These are just my
                                    personal choices, there is no paid
                                    promotion for these sites, just online
                                    places that I have found.<br><br>

                                    Im sure many people, like me, back in the
                                    day had a number book for marking off
                                    those items of rolling stock that had been
                                    ‘coped’ or photographed. In today’s
                                    digital world ABRail.co.uk is broadly the
                                    same thing, only kept much more up to
                                    date. Covering locos, carraiges and
                                    multiple units, it has provided a go-to
                                    reference for me on many occasion.<br>

                                    trains are, or whether a freight is running
                                    late. Its still good, and provides a great
